Hey there!

I'm Ming, a data growth engineer based in Hangzhou, China. Currently, I'm working at an open source software company where I leverage Python and Shell to drive growth and innovation. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Swilder-M) or [X](https://x.com/codming). Feel free to drop me a line at [i@codming.com](mailto:i@codming.com).

Thanks for stopping by! ❤️
