Hello everyone! 

My name is Ming and I am a data growth engineer based in Hangzhou, China. I currently work at an open source software company where I utilize languages such as Python and shell to drive growth and innovation. In my free time, you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Swilder-M) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codming). Feel free to reach out to me via email at [i@codming.com](mailto:i@codming.com).
